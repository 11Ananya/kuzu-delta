eKnows.csv
# This is a replica of the graph under 2-bytes-per-edge with 60000 more singletons from p6000 to p65999.
# Because the number of nodes is > 65536, knows edges should use 4 bytes/edge: 0 byte for label and 4 bytes for offset.

vPerson.csv
# This is the same as 2-bytes-per-edge dataset, except we add an additional 60K (from p60001 to 66000) more singletons.
